    "VibraCore is an API service that automates the risk management of building damage during vibration works, such as the installation of sheet piles or driven piles. According to CUR 166 the maximum vibration velocity is predicted. Based on the attributes of the nearby buildings, the failure vibration velocity is calculated (according to SBR A). If the check fails, the building has an unacceptable risk (according to SBR A) of being damaged by the installation of the piles or sheet piles.\n",

To guide inexperienced programmers, we created a library that helps you to communicate with our API. This library is called [`cems-nuclei`](https://cemsbv.github.io/nuclei/) and is available on pypi.\n",
